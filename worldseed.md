Refer to the Discord for the world seed.

You can use [Chunkbase](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map) to search for biomes and structures.

Because the server was transferred between versions, chunks generated before the transfer will use Bedrock 1.19 structure generation, and chunks generated after the transfer will use Java 1.19.3 structure generation.
