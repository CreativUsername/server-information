# Information

Hopefully this is everything you could possibly need to know about the server.

## Joining the Server
To join the server, you must use either Minecraft Java Edition 1.19.3 or Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.19.20 - 1.19.62. No mods are required to join the server, but if you are going to install any mods, they should be client-only.

The Server Name does not matter. You can enter whatever you like in that field. <br>
Refer to the Discord for the server address.

Bedrock players may have to restart their game if it's stuck on "Locating server" when the server is up.

For players on Xbox, these guides might help you join the server: <br>

Here is a small but useful add-on for players who are joining through the PC version of Bedrock edition: <br>

## Dynmap
Refer to the Discord for the URL to the dynmap. You may get a warning because it uses HTTP and not HTTPS. <br>
You can make signs in-game that will appear on dynmap as markers. The format for the sign is:

```
[dynmap]
Marker Name (Line 1)
Marker Name (Line 2)
icon:icon_name
```

`Marker Name (Line 1/2)` can be replaced by the desired name and `icon_name` can be replaced with the icon you wish to use. <br>
`[dynmap]` and `icon:icon_name` will disappear upon placing the sign.

Here is an example:

## Commands

For a full list of all the commands in alphabetical order, refer to [commands.md](commands.md) <br>
For a curated list seperated into groups by functionality, refer to [commands-curated.md](commands-curated.md)

## World Seed

Refer to the Discord for the world seed. You can use https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map to search for biomes and structures.

Because the server was transferred between versions, chunks generated before the transfer will use Bedrock 1.19 structure generation, and chunks generated after the transfer will use Java 1.19.3 structure generation.
