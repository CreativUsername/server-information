## Joining the Server
To join the server, you must use either Minecraft Java Edition 1.19.3 or Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.19.20 - 1.19.62. No mods are required to join the server, but if you are going to install any mods, they should be client-only.

The Server Name does not matter. You can enter whatever you like in that field. <br>
Refer to the Discord for the server address.

Bedrock players may have to restart their game if it's stuck on "Locating server" while the server is up.

## Dynmap
Refer to the Discord for the link to the dynmap. You may get a warning because it uses HTTP and not HTTPS.

## World Seed

Refer to the Discord for the world seed.

You can use https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map to search for biomes and structures. <br>
Because the server was transferred between versions, chunks generated before the transfer will use Bedrock 1.19 structure generation, and chunks generated after the transfer will use Java 1.19.3 structure generation.
