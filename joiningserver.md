To join the server, you must use either Minecraft Java Edition 1.19.3 or Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.19.20 - 1.19.63. No mods are required to join the server, but if you are going to install any mods, they should be client-only.

The Server Name does not matter. You can enter whatever you like in that field. <br>
Refer to the Discord for the server address.

Bedrock players may have to restart their game if it's stuck on "Locating server" while the server is up.
